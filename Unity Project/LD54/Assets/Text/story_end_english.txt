I boarded the rescue helicopter. 

I didn’t look back. 

I just felt lucky that I could escape alive from here.

…

There was a muffled sound of rubble falling heavily to the ground as an external wall collapsed.

The sound of violent fragmentation followed one after another.

But they were all covered up by the buzzing sound of the helicopter.

I felt so tired and fell asleep.
