A violent shake woke me up from my sleep.

I live on the twenty-first floor. 

I leaned out of the window and looked down. 

The bottomless cracks were like vines entwined around the earth. 

In the distance, I could faintly hear the sound of an ambulance.

It was an earthquake.

I wanted to escape downwards, but I could only see the stairs of the twentieth floor disappear into thin air, leaving only half of the railing swaying in mid-air.

"It seems that I have to reach the top floor before the entire building collapses and call for help. Hopefully, a helicopter will come to pick me up."

Although it's only a few steps away from the top floor, the upper floors are not safe either. 

The floor has dangerous cavities due to strong tremors and heavy objects hitting it.

Fortunately, this building has recently been undergoing elevator renovations, and there are a few wooden boards stacked on each floor. 

Although these boards are not sturdy, they will have to do in this emergency situation.
